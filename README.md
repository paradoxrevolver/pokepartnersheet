# pokepartnersheet

a project for punching data about pokemon into a spreadsheet about pokemon, so we don't have to write all that stuff manually.

**to access the google spreadsheet** i created a service account according to the [google-spreadsheet npm directions for authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet#service-account-recommended-method). the google developer console spit out a .json file that i put at /ignore/account-info.json (not in this project for security reasons).
